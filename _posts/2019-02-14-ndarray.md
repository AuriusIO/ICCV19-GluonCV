title: Manipulate Data with NDArray
---

NDArray - primary tool for data storage and transformation in MXNet.

We’ll start by introducing the `NDArray`, MXNet’s primary tool for storing and transforming data. If you’ve worked with `NumPy` before, you’ll notice that a NDArray is, by design, similar to NumPy’s multi-dimensional array. 

## Getting Started

To get started, let's import the `ndarray` package (`nd` is shortform) from MXNet.


```python
import mxnet as mx
from mxnet import nd
```

### Create a 2-D Array

Next, let's see how to create a 2-D array (also called a matrix) with values from two sets of numbers: 1, 2, 3 and 4, 5, 6. This might also be referred to as a tuple of a tuple of integers.


```python
# set ctx=mx.gpu(0) to create one on a GPU
a = nd.array(((1,2,3),(5,6,7)), ctx=mx.cpu())
a
```




    
    [[ 1.  2.  3.]
     [ 5.  6.  7.]]
    <NDArray 2x3 @cpu(0)>



### Create a 2-D Array of Ones

We can also create a very simple matrix with the same shape (2 rows by 3 columns), but fill it with 1s.


```python
ones = nd.ones((2,3))
ones
```




    
    [[ 1.  1.  1.]
     [ 1.  1.  1.]]
    <NDArray 2x3 @cpu(0)>



### Create an Array of Random Values

Often we’ll want to create arrays whose values are sampled randomly. For example, sampling values uniformly between -1 and 1. Here we create the same shape, but with random sampling.


```python
rand_uniform = nd.random.uniform(-1,1,shape=(3,3))
rand_uniform
```




    
    [[ 0.09762704  0.18568921  0.43037868]
     [ 0.68853152  0.20552671  0.71589124]
     [ 0.08976638  0.69450343 -0.15269041]]
    <NDArray 3x3 @cpu(0)>



You can also fill an array of a given shape with a given value, such as `2.0`.
<!-- added to improve multiplication example -->


```python
twos = nd.full((2,3), 2.0)
twos
```




    
    [[ 2.  2.  2.]
     [ 2.  2.  2.]]
    <NDArray 2x3 @cpu(0)>



### Inspect an NDArray's Attributes

As with NumPy, the dimensions of each NDArray are accessible by accessing the `.shape` attribute. We can also query its `size`, which is equal to the product of the components of the shape. In addition, `.dtype` tells the data type of the stored values.


```python
(a.shape, a.size, a.dtype, a.context)
```




    ((2, 3), 6, numpy.float32, cpu(0))



## Operations

NDArray supports a large number of standard mathematical operations.

### Element-wise Operations


```python
twos = nd.full((2,3), 2.0)
a * twos
```




    
    [[  2.   4.   6.]
     [ 10.  12.  14.]]
    <NDArray 2x3 @cpu(0)>




```python
twos.exp()
```




    
    [[ 7.38905621  7.38905621  7.38905621]
     [ 7.38905621  7.38905621  7.38905621]]
    <NDArray 2x3 @cpu(0)>



### Matrix Multiplications

And grab a matrix’s transpose to compute a proper matrix-matrix product:


```python
nd.dot(a, a.T)
```




    
    [[  14.   38.]
     [  38.  110.]]
    <NDArray 2x2 @cpu(0)>



## Indexing

#### Read a Particular Element

MXNet NDArrays support slicing in all the ridiculous ways you might imagine accessing your data. Here’s an example of reading a particular element, which returns a 1D array with shape `(1,)`.


```python
a[1,2]
```




    
    [ 7.]
    <NDArray 1 @cpu(0)>



#### Read the Second and Third Columns


```python
a[:,1:3]
```




    
    [[ 2.  3.]
     [ 6.  7.]]
    <NDArray 2x2 @cpu(0)>



#### Use Negative Indices


```python
a[-1]
```




    
    [ 5.  6.  7.]
    <NDArray 3 @cpu(0)>



#### Write to a Specific Element


```python
a[:,1:3] = 2
a
```




    
    [[ 1.  2.  2.]
     [ 5.  2.  2.]]
    <NDArray 2x3 @cpu(0)>



#### Use Multi-dimensional Slicing


```python
a[1:2,0:2] = 4
a
```




    
    [[ 1.  2.  2.]
     [ 4.  4.  2.]]
    <NDArray 2x3 @cpu(0)>



## Converting between MXNet NDArray and NumPy

Converting MXNet NDArrays to and from NumPy is easy. The converted arrays do not share memory.


```python
x = a.asnumpy()
(type(x), x)
```




    (numpy.ndarray, array([[ 1.,  2.,  2.],
            [ 4.,  4.,  2.]], dtype=float32))




```python
nd.array(x);
```
